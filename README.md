# VolcanicAshInversion
This repository contains the volcanic ash inversion source code written in Python. 

The source code is used to take a set of forward runs with unit emissions, and then find the combination of these that matches observations from sattelite images best. 

The code first generates an a priori estimate of ash emissions from observations of ash cloud heihgt. It then continues by colocating ash simulatinons with the observations, and finally assemble these source (forward simulation) - receptor (satellite image) relationships into a large source-receptor matrix. We then use least squares with Tikhonov regularization to find the emissions that match the observatios best. 

# Running example
The following helps you set up a minimal working example of the source code and run a simple inversion. 

This documentation assumes that you have the following directory structure after having followed all the steps:
```
VolcanicAsh
`-> VolcanicAshInversion
|   `-> AshInv
|   |   `-> AshInversion.py
|   |   `-> ...
|   `-> bin
|   |   `-> inversion_job_setup.sh
|   |   `-> ...
|   |   `-> inversion.sh
|   `-> ash_inv.yml
|   `-> ...
`-> forward_runs
|   `-> ASHinv20100414T0000Z_hourInst.nc
|   `-> ...
|   `-> ASHinv20100417T2100Z_hourInst.nc
`-> satellite
    `-> lognormal_1_5
        `-> MSG2-ASH-IcelandEurope_1088_0088_1537x494-201004161900_ExtendedVOLE_lognormal_1_5_gridded.nc
        `-> ...
        `-> MSG2-ASH-IcelandEurope_1088_0088_1537x494-201004161900_ExtendedVOLE_lognormal_1_5_gridded.nc
```

Start by creating the parent directory `VolcanicAsh`
```
mkdir VolcanicAsh
```

## Cloning source code

The source code can be downloaded from github
```
cd VolcanicAsh
git clone https://github.com/babrodtk/VolcanicAshInversion.git
```
should clone the source code from Github. Now test that you get expected results from the regression tests:
```
cd VolcanicAsh/VolcanicAshInversion
bin/inversion_test.sh
```
should give something like the following:
```

## Downloading data

The data for forward simulations and satellite observations of the Eyjafjalla 2010 eruption is arcived on Zenodo, and can be downloaded automatically to the correct location using the following script:
```
cd VolcanicAsh
VolcanicAshInversion/bin/inversion_download_eyjafjalla.sh
```

## Setting up an inversion job
The volcanic ash source code can set up a job for you. The scripts copy the configuration into a separate directory, and run the inversion from there for reproducibility. It is very easy to get mixed up when running multiple inversions (e.g., when experimenting with parameters), so the system is set up to be able to track what parameters were used to generate a given result.
```
cd VolcanicAsh/VolcanicAshInversion
bin/inversion_job_setup.sh --tag EYJAFJALLA --conf input_data/eyja/conf_real
```
This should then give something like the following output:
```

############## END SUMMARY ###############
```
You can now take a look at the configuration files in the directory 
```
/home/jupyter-babrodtk/VolcanicAsh/VolcanicAshInversion/output/EYJAFJALLA_20220317T1052Z
```
(make sure you substitute this path with the actual path on your machine)
The contents of the folder should be something like the following:
```
EYJAFJALLA_20220317T1052Z
`-> a_priori_EYJAFJALLA.dat
`-> ash_simulations_EYJAFJALLA.csv  
`-> conf_inversion_EYJAFJALLA.ini
`-> job_script_EYJAFJALLA.sh
`-> ash_observations_EYJAFJALLA.csv
`-> conf_a_priori_EYJAFJALLA.ini
`-> conf_match_files_EYJAFJALLA.ini
`-> plume_heights_EYJAFJALLA.csv
```


## Running an inversion job
After the inversion job has been set up, and you have inspected the configuration files, you can run the job by submitting to your queueing system (e.g., qsub), or run directly on your computer as follows:
```
cd VolcanicAsh/VolcanicAshInversion/output/EYJAFJALLA_20220317T1052Z
./job_script_EYJAFJALLA.sh
```
which should start the inversion procedure which takes approximately ten minutes and ends with something like the following:
```
